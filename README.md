The Potchefstroom North West University tutoring program Lexicon is transitioning from a paper-based system to a complete digital database. The project's objective is to use a simplified digital solution to handle the issues that come with manual operations, such mistakes, delays, and restricted scalability.
Oracle was used to construct and maintain the databases for the digital system's implementation, and SQL statements were used to effectively manipulate and retrieve data.

**Goals:**  

**Efficiency Gains:** To cut down on mistakes and expedite processes, automate administrative duties.  
**Appointment Scheduling:** Make it easier for students to schedule tutoring sessions according to their academic requirements.  
**Monitoring and Administration:** Organize student appointments, payments, and location accessibility more effectively.  
**Scalability:** Create a system that can keep up with the business's explosive expansion.  

**Covered Operations:**
Transaction management includes keeping track of finances, keeping track of payments, and handling invoices.  
**Appointment Scheduling:** Assign tutors to students and set up appointments.  
**Venue Management:** Schedule and oversee tutoring sessions at academic institutions.  
**Administrative tasks:** Effectively manage data, documents, and records.  

**System requirements:**
Include information about the tutor and the student, the appointment schedule, the transaction history, and the location.  
**Scope:** Track transactions, automate scheduling, centralize data storage, and manage venue utilization.  
**Boundaries:** Make sure software is compatible with current systems, utilize technology that is already in place with the possibility of updates, and develop within budgetary restrictions.  

**Business Rules:**  
For effective data management and operational flexibility, define relationships such as one-to-many between appointments and instructors, locations, courses, and students.
